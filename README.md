# Nature Inspired Optimization Algorithms

###### Python code for "Multi-fidelity Meta-optimization for Nature Inspired Optimization Algorithms"

The python code had been made in the format as in the manuscript "Multi-fidelity Meta-optimization for Nature Inspired Optimization Algorithms" submitted to "Applied soft computing".
The code has been modified and updated for new algorithms, updated algorithms and new benchmark functions.

## To run an algorithm
1. Import the algorithm and the appropriate benchmark (refer to run_algo.py).
2. If a custom function has to be minimized, add it as in the run_algo.py file.
3. Run the run_algo.py file.
```python run_algo.py```
